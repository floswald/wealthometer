				<p>The tax calculator on this webpage allows you to predict:                 
                <ol>
                  <li>how much a reform of (wealth) taxes would cost or benefit you, depending on the tax exempt amount and the tax rate,</li>
                  <li>how much more or less other people with different levels of wealth
     would have to pay, </li>
                  <li>and how much government revenue it would generate.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>To explain what this calculator does, it is useful to briefly talk about how
economists think about the impact of tax reforms, and about how tax rates
should "optimally" be set. When the government changes some tax rate, a
number of things can happen at the same time: </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Just  mechanically,  everybody  has  to  pay  more  or  less  taxes on the wealth they had before the tax reform,
     and  correspondingly  the  government  receives  more  or  less  revenues.
     ("Mechanical effects") </li>
                  <li>Individuals might react to the changing taxes, for instance by saving
     more or less money.  "Saving" means that individuals don't spend their money on consumption, but instead invest it in savings accounts, real estate, stocks, funds, etc.
They might also react by changing how much they cheat on their taxes. This might affect (a) government revenues, (b) those who change their behavior, and (c) other individuals. ("Behavioral effects")</li>
                  <li>Changes in behavior might lead to a change in market prices or interest
     rates, which can make different individuals better or worse off. ("Price
     effects") </li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>How do these effects enter our calculations?</p>
                
                <strong>1. Mechanical Effects</strong>
                
                
                <p>This is the simplest, but also most important part of our calculations.
     To  calculate  mechanical  effects,  we  use  the  information  about
     the  distribution  of  wealth  that  is provided by the
     <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/scfindex.htm"><em>Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)</em></a>.
We probably underestimate mechanical effects on government revenues, as we underestimate the assets of very wealthy households.</p>
     
               
               <strong>2. Behavioral effects:</strong>
                    
                  <p style="text-indent:50px;"><strong>a) ... On government revenues:</strong></p>
                    
                <p>When individuals save less or start
          to evade taxes more frequently after an increase in wealth taxes,
          this means that the government might gain less in tax revenues
          than  we  would  think  based  on  mechanical  calculations  (since
          there is less declared wealth to be taxed). How large this behavioral
          effect on government revenues is, is a difficult empirical question.
          What we know is that most of the effects are taking place because
          of increased evasion or avoidance, rather than through decreased
          savings. Most empirical studies have found little to no effect of
          returns  (net interest rates, rental income from real estate, capital gains from stocks, etc.) on how much people actually save.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a> <br>
                  <br>
                  We base our calculations on the assumption that, because of tax
          evasion, increases in government revenues are about 20% less than
          suggested by mechanical calculations. This number is probably
          overestimating the behavioral effect of tax increases. If taxes are
          well enforced then the behavioral effect might well be smaller.</p>
               
       
             <p style="text-indent:50px;"><strong>b)... On those changing their behavior:</strong></p>
               
                <p>When individuals save
          less  or  start  to  evade  taxes  more  frequently  after  an  increase
          in wealth taxes, this means that they might actually be better
          off than suggested by the mechanical calculation of how much
          they  have  to  pay.  After  all,  they  could  simply  have  done  the
          same as they did before the tax reform (that is, they could have saved the same and not changed how much they cheat on taxes), but chose not to. Taking this line of reasoning further, it can be shown that in fact behavioral
          changes can be ignored when calculating the effect of the reform
          on individuals.
</p>
                
                <p style="text-indent:50px;"><strong>c)... On other individuals:</strong></p>
                
                
                <p>In a competitive market with property
          rights,  such  as  the  capital  markets  of the  US,  the
          owners of capital (savings, real estate, stocks, etc.) generally gain all the returns to their
          capital. Contrary to claims often made in public debate, no one
          else profits from their continuing participation. That means that nobody else is directly affected
          by any of their behavioral changes.</p>
                
                
                <strong>3. Effects on prices and interest rates:</strong>
                
                <p>In principle, a change in wealth taxes might shift
     savings to such an extent that the available capital in the economy
     and thereby the real interest rate do change. In practice, these
     effects are very small. Two reasons for this are that (i) capital is
     globally mobile and changes in savings in one country will have a
     negligible effect on the global capital stock, and (ii) the behavioral
     effects of interest rates on savings (as opposed to tax evasion) are
     empirically very small. Following standard practice in the academic
     literature, our calculations therefore assume that there are no price
     effects. </p>
                <p>Based on these different effects, we know how much any given person or
household is affected by the tax reform. To get an effect "for the entire economy,"
we have to somehow sum these effects up. But of course an additional dollar for a
poor person is not the same as an additional dollar for a rich person. It makes no
sense to say that giving $100 to a person earning $10,000 per year is the
same as giving $100 to a person making $100,000 per year.
We have to make a trade-off between different people, and choose how
much weight we assign to poor versus rich people, when summing up.
These weights are a matter of distributive justice that economists do not
have more to say about than anyone else; at the end of the day this is a
matter of "picking a side" &#8211; who do we think should get additional
income?
<br>
                  Building on such considerations, economists then discuss the "effect on
social welfare" of a change in tax rates. This effect on social welfare is given
by the sum of the weighted effects on all the individuals in the economy.
Economists say a choice of tax rates is "optimal" if no change is possible that
would increase "social welfare."<br>
                  On this website, we show you how much different people would gain or lose
from tax changes that you propose. It is up to you to decide how you evaluate
these gains and losses.</p>
