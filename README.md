this repo contains html and java source code for the website 
`http://wealthometer.org`

## structure

* there is a central `/css` and `/img` folder at the root of the site.
all country sites are set up as subfolders of the root, with
each of them referring to the root-level css and img.
* I changed the `main.css` to center the `nav` blocks.
* Each country folder has their own `js` directory, which contains
code and country-specific data for the tax calculator.
