## location

* this is a privately hosted git repository. please send an email to florian.oswald@gmail.com

as that would defeat the purpose.

## content

`http://wealthometer.org`

## structure

* there is a central `/css` and `/img` folder at the root of the site.
all country sites are set up as subfolders of the root, with
each of them referring to the root-level css and img.
* Each country folder has their own `js` directory, which contains javascript
code and country-specific data for the tax calculator.
